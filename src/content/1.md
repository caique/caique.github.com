My name is Caique Rodrigues and currently I'am a Software Consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com/).

My work is basically build digital platforms from scratch while migrating the existent legacy systems.

Currently, my favorite subjects are:
- Microservices Architectures
- Event Driven Architectures
- Continuous (Delivery + Deployment + Integration)
- DevOps
- Infrastructure as Code

Be aware that all insights in this blog are subject to criticism and are, in fact, invitations to discuss about technology in order to build knowledge in a collaborative way. After all, there is no silver bullets and we're all learning!
